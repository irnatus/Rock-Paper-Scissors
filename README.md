# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First project using javascript.
Practiced using switch instead of if and else if. 
Learned that using var lead to a lot of problems in javascript.
Let is block scoped and var is function scoped. 

Learned about loading javascript after html by using the keyword defer in the opening script tag. (30 minutes playing around with eventListeners before I realized why nothing was happening)

Practiced using eventListeners. the event object is automatically passed through to named function calls. 

Practiced and played around with lots of DOM manipulation.
